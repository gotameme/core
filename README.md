# Go! Tame! Me!

## Overview

Go! Tame! Me! is an ambitious simulation project, born from my personal journey with the classic game Ant!Me! nearly 20
years ago. This adventure was not only immensely fun but also profoundly educational, introducing me to the captivating
world of simulation games. With Go! Tame! Me!, my aim is to channel the excitement I experienced with Ant!Me! into the
modern realm of Go programming. This project, a personal endeavor of mine, is currently in its infancy, where ants are
capable of performing basic tasks such as collecting sugar and utilizing markers for communication.

## Current Capabilities

- **Basic Ant Behavior:** Ants can navigate their environment to collect sugar and return it to their nest. They are
  also capable of setting markers containing information, facilitating communication among themselves. This forms a
  simple yet compelling challenge that captures the essence of what made Ant!Me! so intriguing.

## Planned Objectives

- **Dynamic Ant Simulation:** I am committed to enhancing the dynamics and realism of ant behavior simulation.
- **Multiplayer Functionality:** I envision developing an online multiplayer experience that connects players across the
  globe.
- **Custom Scenarios:** I am passionate about providing a platform where players can unleash their creativity through
  the creation and sharing of unique scenarios.
- **AI Module Development:** By introducing an open API for custom AI behavior development, I plan to expand the
  simulation's boundaries.

## Extended Goals

In addition to development and crafting a dynamic ant simulation, one of my core ambitions with Go! Tame! Me! is to
demystify the world of open-source development for all participants and users. As a personal project, it's designed to
deliver genuine value and nurture learning experiences by leveraging the power of well-established open-source
techniques and platforms. While GitHub (with its Pages, Issue Tracker, and Wiki) serves as a primary example, the
project also embraces a broader ecosystem including Go (Golang), Git, and other open-source tools and platforms that
contribute to an inclusive and educational environment. Here are some targeted objectives to foster this ethos:

- **Broad Open-Source Engagement:** Encourage the use and understanding of a wide range of open-source tools and
  platforms beyond GitHub, emphasizing the versatility and community spirit of the open-source world.
- **Diverse Learning Experiences:** Provide opportunities for participants to learn not just about coding, but about
  version control with Git, community interaction through issue tracking, and knowledge sharing via wikis and other
  platforms.
- **Community Collaboration:** Promote a culture of collaboration and sharing, encouraging contributors to engage with
  the project in various capacities - from coding to documentation, design, and community management.
- **Open-Source Advocacy:** Act as a beacon for open-source values, demonstrating the benefits of transparency,
  collaboration, and shared knowledge in software development and beyond.

This project is not just about developing a game; it's about creating a platform for learning, sharing, and growing
together in the open-source community. By engaging with a variety of tools and platforms, Go! Tame! Me! aims to provide
a comprehensive learning experience that showcases the richness and diversity of open-source software development.
