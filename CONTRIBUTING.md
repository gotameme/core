# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project, Go! Tame! Me! We are in the very early stages of
development, offering numerous opportunities for you to make a significant impact. With many areas still under
development, including tests, documentation, and features, now is an ideal time to share your ideas and code.

## Communication and Questions

In these initial stages, the GitHub Issue Tracker serves as our primary channel for questions, suggestions, and
discussions. We encourage open and supportive communication, free from prejudice and harassment. To facilitate global
participation, we kindly request that communication be conducted in English. Tools like Google Translate or DeepL can
assist those less comfortable with English. If necessary, consider utilizing AI tools as "social filters" to ensure
respectful interaction.

### Communication Expectations

While we strive to maintain an open and active communication channel through the GitHub Issue Tracker, it's important to
remember that Go! Tame! Me! is a personal project developed in my spare time. I aim to respond as quickly as possible,
but please understand there are no formal Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Your patience and understanding are greatly
appreciated as we work together to make this project a success.

### Community Support

In addition to contributions, we highly encourage everyone in the community to help each other. Whether it's answering
questions, reviewing pull requests, or providing feedback on issues, your support for fellow contributors is invaluable.
This project thrives on collaboration, and by helping each other, we can achieve more and create a welcoming environment
for everyone involved. Your willingness to share knowledge and offer assistance is what makes the open-source community
so powerful.

## Contributions of All Kinds

We welcome and value contributions of all kinds, from coding and documentation to sharing ideas and providing feedback.
Given the project's infancy, we are particularly open to innovative suggestions and methodologies.

## The Contribution Process

1. **Explore the Issues**: Browse existing issues or initiate a new one to discuss your ideas or address problems you
   wish to solve.
2. **Fork and Clone**: Ready to contribute? Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
3. **Develop Your Solution**: Work on your fork to implement your solution. Although our testing framework is in
   development, we encourage you to test your code to the best of your ability. We highly value tested code for
   maintaining project quality.
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Submit a pull request once your solution is ready. Please clearly explain what you've
   changed and the significance of your contribution. If you've added tests for your code, highlight this in your PR.
5. **Review and Merge**: Project maintainers will review your PR. Be prepared for potential questions or requests for
   adjustments before your contribution is merged.

## Testing is on the Horizon

Currently, we lack a formal testing infrastructure; however, establishing a comprehensive testing environment is a
priority. Contributions that include tests are especially valuable, laying a solid foundation for the project's future
and ensuring its reliability. If you have expertise in setting up testing frameworks and are willing to assist in this
area, your contribution would be immensely appreciated.

## Coding Guidelines

While specific coding guidelines have yet to be established due to the project's early phase, we ask contributors to
adhere to some general best practices:

- Write clear, maintainable code.
- Comment your code as necessary to explain your thought process.
- Follow the generally accepted conventions of the language you're using.

## Thank You

Each contribution, regardless of size, is immensely valued. We are on a thrilling journey together, and your involvement
truly makes a difference. Thank you for your support and participation.
